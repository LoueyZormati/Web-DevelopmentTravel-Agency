# Travel Agency Website

This is a simple front-end project developed using **HTML** and **CSS**.  
It represents a travel agency website, created to practice web development and showcase UI design skills.

## 🧪 About Me

I'm a **QA Automation Tester**, and although my main focus is on testing (manual and automated), I built this project to better understand front-end development and how UI elements work — essential knowledge for UI testing and automation scripting.

## 💡 Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3  

## 🔍 Why This Project?

As an automation tester, understanding how web pages are built helps me write more robust test scripts using tools like Selenium, Playwright, or Cypress.  
This project allowed me to:
- Practice basic front-end development
- Improve my understanding of DOM structure
- Prepare for UI test automation
